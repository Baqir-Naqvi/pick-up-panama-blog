            <p>My name is Alex. I am a Panamanian American and have traveled to Panama multiple times.</p>
            <p>When we travel out of the country, we have the opportunity to learn from other cultures.</p>
            <p>What we learn from traveling becomes clear when we return home.</p>
            <p>Based on my trips to Panama, I created Pick Up Panama to answer questions about Panama.</p>
