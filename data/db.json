      "id": "is-panama-safe",
      "className": "safety",
      "body": "Panama is one of the safest countries in Central America. You will find that most Panamanians are friendly and welcoming people. ",
      "bodyTwo": "There is a moderate crime rate in Panama. Although the crime rate in Panama City is much lower than some major US cities such as St.Louis, Missouri and Chicago Illinois, the crime rate in Panama has increased slightly over the past three years.",
      "bodyTwoA": " Still, the chances of you getting mugged is slim. You will see a lot of police and armed security patrolling most establishments. This can give you a feeling of safety, but there are preventative measures you can take to stay safe in Panama. This article will cover preventing muggings, recognizing scams, health safety and areas to avoid.",
      "h2": "Who do muggers go after first",
      "bodyThree": "Muggers have different criteria that dictate who their next victim will be. Gender, age, physical build, how you are dressed, time of day and whether or not you are alone all factor in.",
      "h3": "People who are alone",
      "bodyFour": "Most of the time a mugger is going to target someone who is by themself and in an isolated area. Train station platforms, alleys or parking lots are where you need to exercise extreme caution. Do your best to avoid any desolate areas. If you do take the train, stay alert and keep close to other commuters.",
      "bodyFourA": "Oftentimes a mugger will approach under the pretense of asking you for directions or making small talk.  If this happens, you can go ahead and give them directions but keep your distance, glance at their hands and confidently look them straight in the eyes. If you are walking and they come up and start walking alongside you, don't break stride and head to the nearest crowded area if they continue to  follow you.",
      "h3One": "People who look Unsure of themselves",
      "bodyFive": "Muggers will size up a person's body language before making their move. They target people who look inattentive, lost or distracted. They are looking for a person who has a lazy slouching posture or looks at the ground when they walk. Plan your routes ahead of time so that you know where are going before you even leave your hotel. If you have to ask for directions on the way, a mugger will know that you are lost and will target you. The best case scenario is to plan your route so that you will be walking down main streets with lots of people on them.",
      "bodySix": "If you are able, walk tall with your shoulders back and your eyes level. This will give you better awareness of your environment. Maintain situational awareness by leaving your headphones off and don’t text or look at your phone while you walk.",
      "bodySeven":"When you are going around corners, take wide turns so that you can see what is around the corner. Muggers like to ambush people as they come around corners.",
      "bodyEight": "Muggers will move in when they see somebody walking while texting because it is clear that you are not paying attention. You want to watch and listen to your surroundings.If you do so, you will be able to spot potential threats. When you see a potential threat, move to a safer area.",
      "bodyNine": "Take note of people sitting in parked cars and people who appear to just be standing around. Glance side to side from time to time as you walk and quickly make eye contact when you walk past people. Walking with purpose and showing that you are not afraid of a little eye contact will show that you are a confident and on the ball person. You will not be the first choice for a mugger.",
      "bodyTen": "When you enter the location that you are going to,  do a quick scan of the people around you and assess the mood/atmosphere of the place. Sit with a vantage point that allows you to see the entrance and check to see where the emergency exits are ahead of time.",
      "h3Two": "People who project wealth",
      "bodyEleven": "Muggers target people who look like they have money. Tourists with expensive clothes, jewelry, or designer sunglasses and cufflinks are prime targets.",
      "bodyTwelve": "Try not to dress or act like a tourist. Branded designer clothes let muggers know that you are not from the area and that you have money. Dress modestly, don’t overdo it with selfies and don’t flash wads of money.  Leave expensive jewelry at home. Just carry enough money for whatever you need for that outing and leave the rest hidden in your hotel room.",
      "bodyThirteen": "Before you access your cash to pay for something, use an ATM machine or stop to take a selfie, look around carefully and trust your intuition. If something just seems suspicious or out of place, hold off on that until you find a safer location.",
      "h2One": "What to do if you are getting mugged",
      "bodyFourteen":"If you are mugged, simply comply with the mugger and give them what they want so that you don’t risk injury. Don’t argue with them or try to talk to them. All of the prevention measures mentioned earlier and confidence may still not be enough to deter a mugger.",
      "bodyFifteen": "Many muggers are looking to commit their crime quickly, quietly and without assaulting the victim. However, muggers are desperate people who will resort to physical or armed violence to get what they want.",
      "bodySixteen": "You may want to consider keeping a dummy wallet on you. This is a wallet that would contain small bills, old receipts, coupons, business cards and an expired credit card. The idea is that in case of a mugging you can throw this toward the mugger so that you are not out a lot of cash and your real credit cards.",
