      "id": "is-panama-safe",
      "className": "safety",
      "body": "Panama is regarded as one of the safest countries in Central America. You will find that most Panamanians are friendly and welcoming people. ",
      "bodyTwo": "There is a moderate crime rate in Panama. Although the crime rate in Panama City is much lower than in some major US cities such as St.Louis, Missouri, and Chicago, Illinois, the crime rate in Panama has increased slightly over the past three years.",
      "bodyTwoA": "Despite this, the likelihood of you being mugged is slim. Most establishments are patrolled by police and armed security. While this can give you a sense of safety, there are other precautionary measures you can take to maintain safety in Panama. This article will cover preventing muggings, recognizing scams, health and safety and areas to avoid.",
      "h2": "Who are the prime targets for muggers?",
      "bodyThree": "Muggers have different criteria that dictate who their next victim will be. Gender, age, physical build, how you are dressed, time of day and whether or not you are alone all factor in.",
      "h3": "People who are alone",
      "bodyFour": "Most of the time a mugger is going to target someone who is by themself and in an isolated area. Train station platforms, alleys or parking lots are where you need to exercise extreme caution. Do your best to avoid any desolate areas. If you do take the train, stay alert and keep close to other commuters.",
      "bodyFourA": "Oftentimes a mugger will approach under the pretense of asking you for directions or making small talk.  If this happens, you can go ahead and give them directions but keep your distance, glance at their hands and confidently look them straight in the eyes. If you are walking and they come up and start walking alongside you, don't break stride and head to the nearest crowded area if they continue to  follow you.",
      "h3One": "People who look Unsure of themselves",
      "bodyFive": "Muggers will size up a person's body language before making their move. They target people who look inattentive, lost or distracted. They are looking for a person who has a lazy slouching posture or looks at the ground when they walk. Plan your routes ahead of time so that you know where are going before you even leave your hotel. If you have to ask for directions on the way, a mugger will know that you are lost and will target you. The best case scenario is to plan your route so that you will be walking down main streets with lots of people on them.",
      "bodySix": "If you are able, walk tall with your shoulders back and your eyes level. This will give you better awareness of your environment. Maintain situational awareness by leaving your headphones off and don't text or look at your phone while you walk.",
      "bodySeven":"When you are going around corners, take wide turns so that you can see what is around the corner. Muggers like to ambush people as they come around corners.",
      "bodyEight": "Muggers will move in when they see somebody walking while texting because it is clear that you are not paying attention. You want to watch and listen to your surroundings.If you do so, you will be able to spot potential threats. When you see a potential threat, move to a safer area.",
      "bodyNine": "Take note of people sitting in parked cars and people who appear to just be standing around. Glance side to side from time to time as you walk and quickly make eye contact when you walk past people. Walking with purpose and showing that you are not afraid of a little eye contact will show that you are a confident and on the ball person. You will not be the first choice for a mugger.",
      "bodyTen": "When you enter the location that you are going to,  do a quick scan of the people around you and assess the mood/atmosphere of the place. Sit with a vantage point that allows you to see the entrance and check to see where the emergency exits are ahead of time.",
      "h3Two": "People who project wealth",
      "bodyEleven": "Muggers target people who look like they have money. Tourists with expensive clothes, jewelry, or designer sunglasses and cufflinks are prime targets.",
      "bodyTwelve": "Try not to dress or act like a tourist. Branded designer clothes let muggers know that you are not from the area and that you have money. Dress modestly, don't overdo it with selfies and don't flash wads of money.  Leave expensive jewelry at home. Just carry enough money for whatever you need for that outing and leave the rest hidden in your hotel room.",
      "bodyThirteen": "Before you access your cash to pay for something, use an ATM machine or stop to take a selfie, look around carefully and trust your intuition. If something just seems suspicious or out of place, hold off on that until you find a safer location.",
      "h2One": "What to do if you are getting mugged",
      "bodyFourteen":"If you are mugged, simply comply with the mugger and give them what they want so that you don't risk injury. Don't argue with them or try to talk to them. All of the prevention measures mentioned earlier and confidence may still not be enough to deter a mugger.",
      "bodyFifteen": "Many muggers are looking to commit their crime quickly, quietly and without assaulting the victim. However, muggers are desperate people who will resort to physical or armed violence to get what they want.",
      "bodySixteen": "You may want to consider keeping a dummy wallet on you. This is a wallet that would contain small bills, old receipts, coupons, business cards and an expired credit card. The idea is that in case of a mugging you can throw this toward the mugger so that you are not out a lot of cash and your real credit cards.",
      "h2Two": "Higher Crime Areas in Panama",
      "bodySeventeen": "According to incidents reported to the Panamanian local police, the high crime areas around Panama City are:",
      "listItemA":"San Miguelito",
      "listItemB": "Rio Abajo",
      "listItemC": "El Chorrillo",
      "bodyEighteen": "Most of the crime reported in these areas are amongst rival gang members and not against tourists.",
      "bodyNineteen": "Casco Viejo is fine during the day. It is very tourist and pedestrian friendly. It is usually pretty crowded so watch out for pickpockets. While walking through there and to the Fish Market, I always feel safe. The presidential Palace is around there, so you will see lots of police around as well as group tours.",
      "bodyTwenty": "Casco Viejo sits next to a few rough looking housing projects, so I advise that you don't walk back to your hotel from Casco Viejo because you don't want to walk through some of these neighborhoods on foot.",
      "h3Three": "Colon",
      "bodyTwentyOne": "Colon is on the Atlantic side and is known as a high crime area. If you want to visit, only sign up for tours with an established company. Most muggers in Colon pose as cab drivers or are phony tour guides. They will  aggressively approach tourists and demand to be hired for their “services”. Stay with the group and you should be okay.",
      "h3Four": "The Darien Gap",
      "bodyTwentyTwo": "The Darien Gap is near the Columbian border. It is a dangerous remote stretch of rainforests and jungle.The roads are treacherous, there are flashfloods, insects and snakes. Most of the journey involves climbing steep mountains and going through muddy swamps in the pouring rain. Criminal and human trafficking networks operate in this area and there is a limited police presence.  Migrants from South America attempt the trek all the time in hope for a better life.",
      "bodyTwentyThree":"There are thrill seeking adventure tourists who seek out the Darien Gap as part of their vacation. It's up to you but if you decide to go there, do so with an established company and hopefully have some solid training under your belt.",
      "h2Three": "Is it safe to drink the water in Panama?",
      "bodyTwentyFour": "The hygiene standards that are enforced by the Panama Canal Company are high. So, in Panama City and most areas of Panama, the water is safe to drink directly from the tap.",
      "bodyTwentyFive": "Before traveling to Panama, I make sure to be up to date with my Hepatitis A shots. This will help protect you from contaminated food and water. I have heard reports of Boquete and Bocas Del Toro having issues with contaminated water.",
      "bodyTwentySix":"To play it safe, I would recommend that you drink bottled water when you first get there and drink small amounts of tap water while your body gets used to it.",
      "h2Four": "Insects and mosquitos",
      "bodyTwentySeven": "Panama does have a lot of insects and mosquitos especially during the rainy season. Check and make sure that your windows have screens on them. If you are going to be exploring the Gamboa jungle or be on a boat, make sure to use a good quality insect repellent or wear loose fitting long sleeved shirts and long pants.",
      "h2Five": "Other Tips",
      "listItemD":"Share your travel itinerary and hotel info to family and friends back home.",
      "listItemE": "Before leaving your hotel, let the staff know where you are going and when you expect to return.",
      "listItemF": "Consider signing up for the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program. This is a free service that lets the U.S. Embassy know about your whereabouts and can help family and friends get in touch with you in emergencies.",
      "listItemG":"Keep valuables zipped up and deep in your hidden pockets or money belt.",
      "listItemH": "Don't keep all of your cash in one place. Use different pockets, in your shoe, etc.",
      "listItemI": "Keep a rubber band around your wallet so you can actually feel and hear it rubbing if the wallet were to leave your pocket.",
      "listItemJ":"Do a quick mental checklist every so often to make sure you have everything.",
      "listItemK": "Be very guarded about where you hide your valuables. Don't keep patting your pocket to check if your money is still there. Thieves will notice this and target you.",
      "listItemL": "Never leave your purse or backpack on a bus bench, back of a chair, on a table or on the floor. Keep your hand on it while it's on your lap or your person so you can see it at all times.",
      "listItemM":"Pickpockets create all types of distractions to get you to drop your guard. Be mindful of  your belongings at all times.",
      "listItemN": "If a commotion, such as an argument breaks out around you, go on instant alert and check your belongings.",
      "listItemO": "take a look back to make sure you didn't leave anything in the taxi or on the train when you get up from your seat.",
      "listItemP":"Check in with family and friends back home during your vacation.",
      "listItemQ": "In Panama, 911 will call an ambulance. 104 will call the police and 103 will call the fire department.",
      "listItemR": "Purchase travel insurance for your trip",
      "listItemS": "Learn a few emergency phrases in Spanish such as…",
      "listItemT": "Keep a copy of your passport with you",
      "listItemU": "Avoid walking alone in unlit deserted areas at night.",
      "bodyTwentyEight":"Overall, Panama is a very safe country and I have not witnessed any crime there myself. I have walked around Panama City day and night and have seen a lot of friendly faces and locals who are willing to converse.",
      "bodyTwentyNine": "Most of these tips can be applied to anywhere you go in order to reduce the risk of becoming a victim of the small amount of crime that does occur here.",
